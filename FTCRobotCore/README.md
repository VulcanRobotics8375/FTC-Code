<br>
an FTC library to make things less confusing. Currently in development, no releases expected until late 2020

# Building this project
If you still feel inclined to try this out during the development stage, or you want to help me develop this library, this is how to build it.
## FOR DEVELOPING
ONLY do this build if you want to work directly off of the github tree instead of a released version.
Clone this repository into the directory of your choice, then in your Android Studio FTC code project select <b>File > New > Import Module...</b>. Select the FTCRobotCore folder you just cloned and let the project build. Most likely, this will fail. there are a few things you have to put in the TeamCode gradle files for everything to work properly. 

## Jitpack
When releases are put out on this repo, I will make sure everything easily works with Jitpack.
