an FTC library to make things less confusing. Currently in development, no releases expected until late 2020

# Building this project
If you still feel inclined to try this out during the development stage, or you want to help me develop this library, this is how to build it.
## FOR DEVELOPING
ONLY do this build if you want to work directly off of the github tree instead of a released version.


## Jitpack
When releases are put out on this repo, I will make sure everything easily works with Jitpack.
