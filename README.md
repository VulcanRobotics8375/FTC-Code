## Code
Nothing too special at the moment, some fun algorithms and such is the most interesting thing. 

We use [DogeCV](https://github.com/dogecv/DogeCV) for our vision library

Currently in the process of developing an FTC testing environment that you can use in existing code with easily, but its development has barely started.
